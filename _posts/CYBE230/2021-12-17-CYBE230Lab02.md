This lab we continue with the creation of virtual machines, this time we created an Ubuntu server. Just like with the desktop we needed to properly setup the proxy again. However, this time, instead of being able to do things with a GUI, it all had to be done from the command-line. For many this was their this first time doing a large amount of Linux, and a first time using only a command-line. So after setting up the server initially, we did things like file manipulation, and doing common tasks like file editing all from the command line.
