This lab helped walks us through creating and installing a virtual machine in the "ISEAGE" environment. This ISEAGE environment is a mock internet hosted with the help of VMWare ESXI. This environment allows our systems to be tested in isolation from the regular internet with no fear of an outside attacker, and having things like DNS, and "public" facing IPs available to all students.

In the lab we set up a very basic Ubuntu Desktop Virtual Machine (VM) in the ISEAGE environment. We also set up the proxy needed to access the internet within ISEAGE, as the only traffic proxied out of the environment are HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP to prevent unwanted traffic going in and out of ISEAGE.
