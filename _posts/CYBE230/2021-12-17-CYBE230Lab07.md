To begin this lab we added a new MX record to our DNS servers (internal and external). After we got the DNS records working correctly, we installed Postfix. With settings to set the mail name, and the addresses to receive on, mailbox size, and the protocols to use. We then installed dovecot, and change the configuration to allow it create and edit folders. During the initial setup we choose not to enable SSL, and to allow plaintext authentication, so that we could view the packets sent to and from the server, and get a better understanding of what they contain. With a good example of the importance of encryption, as by default passwords are sent with base64 cipher on them, which can reversed with many online tools in a matter of seconds. After we were finished with looking at the contents of test emails, we enabled SSL, and created a self-signed certificate. After we had the mail server working locally, we created firewalls rules to allow mail to be sent from other class members into the server for us to read.
