In this lab we talked about passive information gathering on targets. We had to think about a company, and gather information on them like DNS contacts, IP ranges, network path for where servers might be located.

I choose Red Lobster as my company. I found the basic stuff that included all the stuff like IP, location, and DNS contacts. We were also suggested to try to find sensitive information like login pages, or names of employees not listed on the website. I ended up finding a LinkedIn page for the Senior Vice President of IP who posts semi-often. This could allow someone to impersonate him and get access to the company potentially. I also found the login page for the employee portal for the company.
