This lab we talked about Social Engineering can be one of the biggest issues in security. Humans are unpredictable, are often willing to give access to systems, by just asking for it. This can happen with things like phishing where users login on fake login pages, which is specifically what we worked on this lab.

To start off the lab, we went to a website about ```Scrat's Nut Emporium``` and started with gathering information like what is being sold, where it is located, phone number, and website path layouts. After doing this we used the ```Social Engineering Toolkit``` in Kali, to create a clone of the website's login page. We can now navigate to the cloned site and login as a user. When attempting to login to our fake page, you then get sent to the real login page as though an error occurred, while we collect the username and password. The final part of the lab we had to create a fake email using the information gathered, and include it in the lab to show an example of phishing email.
