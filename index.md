Hi I'm Trent Walraven, and I'm a Junior in Cyber Security Engineering at Iowa State University. I'm currently the Vice President of the Information Assurance Student Group at Iowa State. Relating to my major I a also participate in the Cyber Defense Competition held on campus, with a few high placements, and participate in Capture the Flag Competitions. I'm highly interested in physical security alongside the digital aspect of cybersecurity. Beyond security I am a member of the Culinary Science Club, and the Quiz Bowl Club on campus, and have interests in console modding and board games.

I recommend taking a look at my [resume](/resume/), or my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

This website is first iteration of my portfolio, so there may be issues, it would be appreciated if you report them to [siteadmin@trwbox.com](mailto:siteadmin@trwbox.com).
